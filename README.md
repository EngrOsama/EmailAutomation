# EmailAutomation
A simple Python program to automate sending hundreds of emails.

Instructions:

1- Make sure to replace 'your_email@gmail.com' and 'your_email_password' with your actual Gmail email address and password.

2- Consider using an app-specific password instead of your regular Gmail password to avoid potential security issues.

3- Ensure that the 'email_list.xlsx' and 'your_file.pdf' files exist in the same directory as the Python program.

4- The program can send one email at a time with a delay in between. This may not be suitable if you need to send a large number of emails and can be changed to 0.

5- Check the spam folder in the recipient's email account in case the email ends up there.

6- Keep in mind that your email service provider may have a limit to the number of emails you can send in a day.

7- If you use an emailing service other than Gmail, you can change the smtp_server to that of your email service provider.

8- If you do not want to attach a pdf file to the email, simply comment out that part of the code.
